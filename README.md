# Introduction to the Sitka Sound Science Center GitHub Organization

## Documentation for Sitka Sound Science Center Employees and Other Interested Individuals

This repository is a guide for how we use GitHub at the **Sitka Sound Science Center (SSSC)**, whether you're a staff member, intern, student, researcher, or external collaborator.

**A GitHub Presentation (PDF)** is attached above with a visual walkthrough of GitHub basics and organizational practices.

## What is GitHub?

[GitHub](https://github.com) is a platform for collaborating on code, data, documentation, and more using Git, a version control system. At SSSC, we use GitHub to:

- Track and share environmental monitoring and research projects
- Document and publish tools and visualizations
- Coordinate contributions across our research and education programs
- Maintain transparency, reproducibility, and accessibility

---

## Getting Started with SSSC GitHub

### 1. Make a GitHub Account

Go to [github.com/join](https://github.com/join) to create a free account.

### 2. For SSSC Employees, request access if needed

For private/internal repositories, request access from the organization admins or your SSSC supervisor.

### 3. Clone a Repository

To work on a project locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sitka-Sound-Science-Center/<repository-name>.git
````

### 4. Follow Project Instructions

Each repository includes a `README.md` file explaining how to install any dependencies, how the code or data works, and how to contribute.

### 5. Use Git to Make and Track Changes

Basic workflow:

```bash
git pull                              # Get the latest version
git checkout -b your-branch-name      # Make a new branch for your work
git add .                             # Stage changes
git commit -m "Your message"          # Describe what you changed
git push origin your-branch-name      # Upload your work
```

Then, submit a **Pull Request** for review and discussion.
